# Life Tracker



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a project I started to track how my time is spent.
For about 50 days I recorded how many hours are spent on categories such as
- office work
- personal work
- work out
- for fun
- leftover hours(number of hours lived - all categories)
- etc
I also recorded other variables such as
- body weight
- number of pages of books read
- happiness score of the day
- efficiency score of the day

The goal of this is to analyze the recorded data to 
- better understand how much of my time is spent on different categories.
- spent my time more wisely, on things that matter
